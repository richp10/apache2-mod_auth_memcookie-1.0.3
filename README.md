apache2-mod_auth_memcookie-1.0.3
================================

This is the OLD version of mod_auth_memcookie patched to compile on Apache 2.4

The source is from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/authmemcookie and then
patched. 






NOTE:
There is a more recent version of mod_auth_memcookie from the original author
This has added several features and also ported to use libmemcached rather
than libmemcache.

https://github.com/richp10/apache2-mod_auth_memcookie

Unfortunately, this version does not compile for Apache 2.4

Version numbers are now a little confusing as the more up to date version is still 
shown as 1.0.2
